# Invisibility cloak

## About the project##
This is my first of opencv project. I used simple opencv and numpy for this.

## Prereqisite ##
1. Python opencv 
2. Python numpy (for handling matrices)

## Aproach ##
Aproach is simple. I added trackbars to tune to the color of cloak (absent in background). I used morphological transformantion to reduce noice.

## Direction for use ##
1. Download the file invisible.py
2. Choose a static background and run th code
3. When satisfied with background press `Esc` button
4. Now tune the HSV variables upper and lower to fit the colour of cloak
4. Press `Esc` button again.
